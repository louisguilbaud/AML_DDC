Case Narrative QnA
Case Narrative for LEN JACHIMEK
1. Review of Personal Information
Upon reviewing the personal information of Len Jachimek, the following aspects stand out:

Employment Status: Len is self-employed and works in the textile industry through his employer, YILI TEXTILE INC. This occupation can be associated with variable income and cash flow, often linked with higher risks of money laundering.
Annual Income: His reported annual income is $386,000, which is relatively high. However, given his self-employed status, the source and consistency of this income may be more challenging to verify.
High-Risk Indicators: The customer is presently marked as an individual with a high propensity for high-risk withdrawals and transactions. His activities are flagged as an individual subject to a segmentation review, indicating heightened scrutiny.
Unusual Phone Activity: The phone number 7813215200 is linked to three different parties in three distinct states. This could indicate potential suspicious activity points, particularly if these parties are unrelated to him.
2. Analysis of Scenario Fired Events

Flagged Amounts: Total credit amount: $6,426,107.77, Total debit amount: $4,078,878 across 14 transactions.
Analysis: Sudden large inflows followed by significant withdrawals are classic indicators of potential money laundering schemes.

Analysis: Implies potential collusion or shared infrastructure for communication with possibly unrelated entities.
Excessive Transfer Activity with Unrelated Parties:

Details: 4 transfers totaling $1,741,310.
Analysis: High-value transfers to unrelated accounts could signal attempts to disguise fund origins and facilitate transactions with potentially illicit purposes.

Analysis: While minimal, any engagement with high-risk products raises concerns regarding Len’s exposure to risky financial activities.
Foreign Wire Activity:

Details: 7 foreign wire transfers.
Analysis: Frequent international transactions can be a way to obfuscate the source of funds, heightening red flags.
High-Risk Deposits:

Details: 75% of deposits flagged as high-risk.
Analysis: This high percentage indicates a concerning pattern, suggesting reliance on potentially illegitimate sources for deposits.
Party Velocity of Volume Deposits and Wire Withdrawals:

Details: Total credit of $3,667,494 and total debit of $4,078,878.
Analysis: The ratios suggest a trend of withdrawals exceeding deposits; often indicative of potential illicit activity.
Structured Withdrawals:

Analysis: This structured approach is a common tactic used to avoid detection while transferring large sums of money.
Out-of-State Activity:

Analysis: Significantly large out-of-state transactions can signify either legitimate business activities or illicit structuring aimed at obscuring the transaction trail.
Global Analysis of Scenario Fired Events
The aggregation of fired events illustrates a concerning pattern of behavior associated with potentially fraudulent or illicit activities. High volumes of deposits and withdrawals, out-of-state and international transactions, excessive transfers to unrelated parties, and the use of high-risk vehicles indicate an acute risk posed by this customer. The use of a recurring phone number associated with multiple parties raises additional red flags around potential collusion or conspiracy related to financial crimes.

3. Behavioral Indicator and Risk Assessment
Behavioral Indicators:
High transaction frequency and volume in a short time frame.
Involvement with multiple unrelated parties for large transfers.
Significant cash withdrawals following large inflows.
Risk Assessment:
Risk Level: High
Justification: The combination of self-employment, high risk flagged transactions, multiple states activity, and a shared phone number across different parties greatly intensifies the potential for money laundering.
4. Recommendations for Investigator
Given the complexity and potential risk associated with Len Jachimek’s financial activities, the following actions are recommended:

Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Initiate a thorough review of transaction sources, especially the large inflows, to confirm legitimacy.
Contact Third Parties: Communicate with identified parties linked to the phone number to ascertain relationships and transaction purposes.
Transaction Monitoring: Continue to monitor Len’s activities for additional patterns or red flags that may arise.
Involve Law Enforcement if Necessary: Should the investigation yield more concerning evidence, consider reporting to financial crime regulatory agencies to pursue potential money laundering violations.
Internal Review of Policies: Given Len’s engagement in high-risk activities, it would be prudent to review and potentially strengthen internal policies regarding monitoring high-risk customers and transactions.
This scenario necessitates a proactive and cautious approach, given the heightened risk associated with Len Jachimek’s financial behaviors.
